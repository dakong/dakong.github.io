                    <p class = "blog-content">Today was my first time in Seattle. I usually don't travel much, but it is a hobby that I've always wanted to pick up when older. I went as a part of the Amazon Student Brand Ambassador summit. We spent four days in Seattle, all expenses paid, and it was awesome. Although we did spend a lot of the time sitting and listening to the various speakers that Amazon had prepared for us, we got some free time to explore the city. The bar scene in Seattle is lively, and their coffee is the best I've had. I am definitley returning to this city one day. </p>
