        <h1>Summer in the Valley!</h1>
        <p>Posted: 11/04/16</p>
      </header>
      <p>As my summer internship comes to an end, I’m both saddened that I’ll be leaving the place that I’ve called home for the past 3 months, but excited to go back to school to finish up my degree, and to see my friends and family. My summer experience has been amazing so far, and it’s been the most productive summer I’ve ever had. I have had time to "revaluate, reflect, and realize” my life and now have a clearer picture as to what I want to do upon graduation.
      </p>
      <p>Sony Playstation was an awesome experience, and I can’t say that enough. I’ve met extremely smart and talented people. People who have been in the industry 30+ years. Everyone is extremely “chill” but hardworking. I came into this internship having doubts. This is my first time working in industry, and I had a constant fear that I would not enjoy what I do, or underperform. Thoughts of “what if I wasn’t cut out to be a programmer, what if I hated doing this, and what if I didn’t have the technical skills to get things done” kept gnawing in the back of my head. Fortunately I found that I did enjoy what I was doing, and everyday I kept finding myself coming in with a positive attitude, ready to tackle whatever challenges the day had in store for me. I’ve learned a lot, and I didn't just getting better at writing code. I’ve gotten a better understanding of how web applications work, better coding style, picking up a new framework, writing both back end services. I’ve learned that little things, such as naming your variables right, really goes a long way.
      </p>
      <p>My experience doesn’t just stop at the professional aspects. I’ve met a lot of cool and interesting people along the way. Our internship program was very diverse in the fact that we were not exclusive to engineers. There were a lot of interns working on the business side of Playstation. We had a great mix of undergraduates, masters, and PHD students. We were a small group of 36 at the San Mateo campus, and we all got the experience of really getting to know a little bit of everyone. Some complaints that I’ve heard from my friend interning at places where they have 100+ interns, is that they really don’t get the chance to meet everyone. I’m fortunate that I have gotten that chance. They also stuffed a bunch of college students into the Marriott Residence Inn, which definitely helped. We even went out bar hopping and to different clubs together, and have a lot of interesting stories to tell ;)
      </p>
      <p>
         Overall I’m going to miss this place, and I’m grateful to have gotten an experience like this. I’m eager to take what I’ve learned from this summer, and apply it to whatever experience I may have in the future. Even though I’ve been working, and never really had a traditional “summer break” I feel rejuvenated to go back to school and to enjoy my last year at University of California, San Diego.

        <h1>My Website!</h1>
        <p>Posted: 10/29/15</p>

      <p>Hey everyone, welcome to my website. I have went through various re-designs of my website and I’m finally going to settle for this one. A lot of the design principles used on this website were from Google Material design. I enjoy the clean and simple
        interface of Google, and wanted to incorporate some of their design philosophies into my own website.
      </p>
      <p>I will continue to update this website as I am in school in order to keep track of my studies and life experiences. I have never been one to write a blog, but recently I have been thinking about the benefits of keeping track of ones life through
        writing. I think it will be a great way to see the progression of my career as a software engineer.
      </p>
      <p>So I hope you all enjoy the future content that gets posted onto this website. I will be adding a projects section sometime in the future, and will be continually adding new functionalities to this website. One of my biggest goals for this website
        is to incorporate AngularJS and more JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay tuned :)
